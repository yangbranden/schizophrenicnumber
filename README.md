# schizophrenicnumber
Made a program that prints out a schizophrenic number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenic_number) w/ the help of my friend who's a math major.

Uses the recursive function f(n) = 10 f(n - 1) + n (where n is an odd integer)

Takes the square root of the function

Formats the output using a for loop & conditionals
